# Housing-Price-Prediction
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. The notebook includes detailed steps and code for:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and key insights.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and selecting important ones.
4. **Model Training:** Implementing and tuning various regression models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
